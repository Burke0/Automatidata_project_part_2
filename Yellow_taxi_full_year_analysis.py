######### Key Takeaways #########
# The highest distribution of trip distances are below 5 miles, but there are outliers all the way out to 35 miles. There are no missing values.
# There are several trips that have a trip distance of "0.0." What might those trips be? Will they impact our model? 
# The data includes dropoff and pickup times. We can use that information to derive a trip duration for each line of data. This would likely be something that will help the client with their model. 
 
# df['trip_duration'] = (df['tpep_dropoff_datetime']-df['tpep_pickup_datetime'])
